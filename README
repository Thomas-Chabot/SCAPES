This is the project submission for the COMP3004 project of SCAPES for Team 44, Team Rocket.

BUILD: 'make'
  Run that command from the root directory of the project (that is, the directory containing this file).

RUN: ./Main/Main
  This will start up the project, opening the editor window. Code can be written into this editor, saved, loaded, compiled, and executed. Specific program features are listed below.

The project has been developed by Team Rocket, that is - Sean Hodges, Student #101012990. I am Team 44.


The project has:
  - A graphical interface for writing programs, compiling programs, and executing those programs
  - Compilation files will be stored to the same directory as the source code, with the extension 'scaplc'
  - Includes support for all statements listed in the project description - dci, dca, rdi, prt, mov, add, cmp, jls, jmr, jeq, jmp, #, and end

There are two demo programs included in the DemoPrograms folder. These are:
  MinMax - Takes in a list of numbers and prints the input sequence, the largest number, and the smallest number
  BubbleSort - Takes in a list of numbers in unsorted order, performs a bubble sort on the list, and outputs the list in sorted order

Both programs are fully documented, including print statements to describe the sequence of program execution.
 
Finally, the Design Pattern I used is the Factory method, and documentation for the pattern is included under the file DesignPattern.txt.


SOURCE CODE:
	Logic/ contains all core logic
	Interface/ deals with all the contents of the user interface
	Storage/ handles data storage for saving & loading data.
	Main/ is the main program entry point.

DemoPrograms/ contains the demos.
